# 1st Homework of Java Test Automation Course - Solvd laba
This repository stores the 1st homework given by our mentor in the Java Test Automation Course at Solvd laba. It consists in a basic System.out program and a quick sort algorithm made by myself. Was an interesting exercise the last one since the only sorting algorithm that I knew was the bubble one, so I had to make some searches before facing the challenge.
